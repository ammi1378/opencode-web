# Task: Implement ShadCN Sidebar Layout

## Problem Statement

The project needs a root layout with a sidebar navigation component. Currently, there's no main navigation structure in place for the TanStack Router project, and we want to integrate ShadCN's sidebar-02 component (sidebar with collapsible sections) to provide a consistent navigation experience across the application.

## Requirements

1. Implement ShadCN sidebar-02 component using ShadCN MCP
2. Integrate the sidebar into the root project layout for TanStack Router
3. Follow TanStack Router documentation and patterns from `.github/instructions/` folder
4. Ensure the sidebar works with TanStack Router's routing system
5. Make the sidebar collapsible with sections as specified in sidebar-02
6. Properly structure the layout to work as the main application shell

## Expected Outcome

- A functioning root layout with ShadCN sidebar-02 integrated
- Sidebar that works seamlessly with TanStack Router navigation
- Collapsible sections in the sidebar for better organization
- Clean integration following TanStack Router best practices
- Responsive design that works across different screen sizes

## Implementation References

- Use documentation from `.github/instructions/` folder for TanStack Router implementation details
- Reference `tanstack-react-router_setup-and-architecture.instructions.md` for layout patterns
- Reference `tanstack-react-router_routing.instructions.md` for navigation integration
- Use ShadCN MCP for component installation and setup

## Additional Suggestions and Ideas

- Consider implementing navigation items that correspond to main application routes
- Ensure proper TypeScript integration following project patterns
- Consider adding navigation state management if needed
- Plan for future navigation items and menu structure
- Consider mobile responsive behavior for the sidebar

## Other Important Agreements

- Use ShadCN sidebar-02 specifically (sidebar with collapsible sections)
- Integrate with TanStack Router as the routing framework
- Follow existing project architecture and patterns
- Use ShadCN MCP for component management
- Reference provided documentation in `.github/instructions/` for implementation guidance
